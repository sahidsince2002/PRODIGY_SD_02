Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This repository contains two implementations of a simple guessing game where the user generates a random number and then tries to guess the correct number. The game is available in both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) versions. The GUI version is built using the Tkinter library in Python.
In the Guessing Game, a random number is generated within a specified range, and the player tries to guess this number. After each guess, the player is informed whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
